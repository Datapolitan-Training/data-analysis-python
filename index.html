---

# Challenges We Face
--

+ Data is hard to get (web scraping)
--

+ Data is too messy
--

+ Data is too large
--

+ Operation is too complex
--

+ Need to repeat (or automate) tasks
--

+ Need to document analytical steps

---

![img-right-40](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png)
# What is Python?
--

+ [Open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) programming langage
--

+ Useful in standalone scripts or powering fully-featured applications
--

+ Strong support for data analysis and visualization, as well as other programming tasks

---

# Python vs. Excel
--

+ Python is a language for giving a computer a direct set of instructions
--

+ Excel is an application that gives users a visual interface and a set of predefined operations
--

+ Python doesn't have many of the icons, animations, and wizards that are part of applications like Excel 
--

+ Python can work with larger datasets and perform more complex operations, but requires explicit instructions
--

+ Python has more potential to build custom operations and record their operation for future use

---

# Python Facts
--

+ Comes from Monty Python and Flying Circus
--

+ Very flexible and highly readable
--

+ Can work on the commandline and in scripts
--

+ But we're going to use a [Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
--

+ Look in your packet for the weblink to start your own Notebook
--
![img-right-30](images/notebook_start.png)
+ Start a new Python 3 Notebook

---

# [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
--

+ Web application that runs code, as well as visualizations and explanatory text
--

+ Can save notebooks and share them with others
--

+ Acts as a self-contained, visual programming environment, either locally or on a remote server
--

+ Each webpage is a self-contained program (you can't share variables between webpages)
--

+ Great for experimenting, prototyping, or simple scripts
--

+ Works in [multiple programming languages](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages) (with proper configuration)

---

# Using Jupyter Notebook
--

![img-right-45](images/notebook_run.png)
+ Type code into a block and run the block
--

+ You can also press `Shift` + `Enter` to run a block
--
![img-right-40](images/notebook_output.png)
+ The output (if any) will print below
--

+ You can type as much or as little code as you'd like
--

+ You can re-run the block as many times as you'd like

---

# What is Syntax?
--

![img-center-80](images/syntax.png)
.caption[Image Credit: AnonMoos, Public Domain via [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ABasic_constituent_structure_analysis_English_sentence.svg)]

---

# Python Syntax
--

+ [Variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm) hold some value
--

+ You can think of them like the subject of a sentence
--

+ We create variables and assign a value using the `=` sign
```python
a = 1 # assign the value 1 to the variable a ("a is 1")
b = 2 # assign the value 2 to the variable c ("b is 2")
```
--
+ We can perform operations with mathematical operators
```python
c = a + b # add the value of a and b, and assign to variable c 
# ("c is a and b")
```

---

# Functions
--

+ We can use built-in functions for operations
```python
print(c) # print the value of variable c
```
--
+ This is a pre-defined and reusable operation
--

+ Functions are like verbs describing an action
--

+ Ideally perform a single action (like `print()`)
---

# Benefits of Functions
--

+ Make your code more modular
--

+ Can write you're own functions (we'll do that after lunch)
--

+ For now, we'll use functions created by others
--

+ These are usually made avaiable through packages

---

# Your turn
+ Calculate the sum of `5` and `7`, assign the result to a variable and print the result

---

# Packages
--

+ Provide a set of pre-constructed functions
--

+ Usually for some specific task<br>
--
(accessing databases, creating charts, scraping the web)
--

+ If you need to do something, there's probably a package for it
--

+ This helps expand the core functionality of Python
--

+ Even some basic things require packages<br>
--
(like [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) and [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html))
--

+ Import packages using the keyword [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)

---

# Important Packages for Exercises
+ [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/) provides data analytics functionality similar to a spreadsheet 
+ [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/) provides data visualization functionality

# Old Faithful Exercise - Data Download
#### `http://training.datapolitan.com/data-analysis-python/data/faithful.csv`

![img-center-70](images/old_faithful.jpeg)

---

# Analyzing the Data
+ Import the data
```python
df = pd.read_csv('http://training.datapolitan.com/data-analysis-python/data/faithful.csv',index_col=0)
```
--
+ Inspect the data
```python
df.head() # Show the first 5 rows of data
df.tail() # Show the last 5 rows of data
```
--
+ Count the number of rows
```python
df.count() # Count the number of non-null values in each column
```
---

# Analyzing the Data
+ Find the range of values
```python
df.max() # Find the maximum value
df.min() # Find the minimum value
```
--
+ Find the mean (average)
```python
df.mean() # Find the mean value of all non-null columns
```
--
+ Find the median (middle)
```python
df.median() # Find the median value
```
--
+ Or do it all together
```python
df.describe() # Provide summary statistics for all columns
```
---

# Referencing Columns
--

+ To reference a particular column, you use the following syntax:
--

```python
df['Column Name'] # Example of the syntax for referencing a single column
```
--
+ We can then call functions on just that column
--

+ For example, to just get the mean for `eruptions`
```python
df['eruptions'].mean() # Calculate the mean of the eruptions column
```

---

# Visualizing the Data
--

+ To visualize the data, we need to first import the `matplotlib` package
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Imports the visualization package
%matplotlib inline 
# This tells Jupyter to use the package in the webpage
```
--
![img-right-40](images/faithful_chart.png)
+ Then we can create a simple histogram using the `hist()` function
```python
df.hist() # Create a histogram
```
---

# Visualizing the Data
+ We can create a simple scatter plot that shows the values plotted against each other
```python
df.plot.scatter(x='waiting',y='eruptions') # Create a scatter plot 
```
![img-center-60](images/faithful_scatter.png)
---

# Function Chaining
--

+ We can string operations together using the [dot method](http://reeborg.ca/docs/oop_py_en/oop.html)
--

+ This means we can chain operations using a simple dot between operations
--

+ Python executes these from left to right (like we read)
--

+ Example:
```python
car.door.open() # Object car has attribute door with function open
```
--
+ This is a paradigm called [object-oriented programming](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/)
--

+ You don't need to fully understand this to program in Python&nbsp;
--

but it helps

---

# Function Chaining
```python
df.plot.scatter(x='waiting',y='eruptions') # Create a scatter plot
```
--

+ `df` is our dataframe object
--

+ We call the `plot` attribute
--

+ We then add the `scatter` function
--

+ We pass the parameters `x='waiting',y='eruptions'` to tell Python how to plot the data
--

+ We'll experiment more with this after the break

# Algorithms

---

# What is an Algorithm?
--

+ A precise set of instructions required to accomplish a task
--

+ Comprised of three components: Inputs, Operation, Output
--

+ Each step in the operation must be clearly defined and work the same with any input

---

#Data structures

---

#What is a data structure?
--

+ A way of organizing data in a computer program
--

+ The method of organizing data differs across types, allowing for different applications
--

+ Important to use the right data structure for the proper task

---

class:center,middle
#Data structures in Python
##How many can you name?

---

#Lists
--

+ The most versatile data structure in Python
--

+ Can contain multiple data types
--

+ Can be sliced or added to
--

+ Are mutable (can be changed)
--

+ Access individual items by index

--

![img-center-40](images/list1.png)

---

#List functions
--

+ append(_object_) - add object to list
--

+ extend(_list_) - extend original list with elements of specified in list
--

+ insert(_index, object_) - insert object at specified index
--

+ pop(_[index]_) - pop element from list at index and return (default to last value in list)
--

+ remove(_value_) - delete first occurrence of value from list (no return)

---

#List functions
+ reverse - reverse the order of the list in place
--

+ sort() - sort the list
--

+ count(_value_) - count number of occurrences of value
--

+ index(_value_) - find index of first value and return 

--

##For more information, see [the documentation ](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#list)

---

#When to use a list
--

+ When order matters
--

+ When you can look up the value using a simple numerical index
--

+ When your data might be changed, removed, or extended
--

+ When your data doesn’t need to be unique

---

#Sets
--

+ An unordered collection with no duplicate values
--

+ Created using the keyword “set”
--

+ More limited in the types of objects that can be included (must be hashable, no lists)

--

![img-center-55](images/set1.png)

---

#When to use sets
--

+ When you only need unique values
--

+ When the data types you’re working with are relatively basic (hashable)
--

+ When your data changes
--

+ When you need to manipulate your sets mathematically (set supports operations like union, intersection, difference, etc)

---

#Tuples
--

+ Immutable (unchangable) data structure similar to a list
--

+ Can contain elements of different types (don’t need to be hashable)

--

![img-center-60](images/tuple1.png)

---

#When to use tuples
--

+ When your data doesn’t change
--

+ When performance is important (tuples provide better performance because of their immutability)

---

#Dictionaries
--

+ Stores data in key-value pairs
--

+ Provides lookup based on custom keys (instead of numerical indexes)
--

+ Keys must be unique

--

![img-center-100](images/dict1.png)

---

#When to use a dictionary
--

+ When you need to lookup values by a custom key
--

+ When you need a fast way to lookup values
--

+ When your data needs to be modified

---

#Things to remember with a dictionary
--

+ Key-value pairs aren’t stored in order (use `collections.OrderedDict` if you need to key order is important)
--

+ `collections.defaultdict` is a more flexible implementation for creating a dictionary and adding values

--

# We often write algorithms in functions
## So what's a function?

---

# Functions
--

+ Block of organized, reusable code
--

+ Ideally perform a single action
--

+ Make your code more modular

---

# When do I write a function?
--

+ If you find yourself repeating the same code sequence, it’s time to write a function
--

+ [**D**on’t **R**epeat **Y**ourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
--

+ Helps make your code more readable and easier to maintain

---

# Function Example
+ Try this

```python
def add(x,y):
  return x + y
```

# Debugging
--

+ Everyone makes mistakes
--

+ It's just a matter of how serious they are<br>
--
_And fixing them_
--

+ **Semantic errors** -> doing the wrong things
--

+ **Syntax errors** -> using the wrong instructions
--

+ When in doubt, review the documentation

???
+ Students will be introduced to key concepts in identifying and resolving errors
+ This will be done with a lecture/discussion leading into an exercise
+ Class exercise finding errors in code -> slide with code snippets in Markdown with errors
+ deal with issue of correctness

---

# Exercise:

+ Debug your neighbor's Python code and verify results

???
+ Students will examine another student's code, run the code, and fix any errors
+ Students will have a better understanding of how to think in code
+ Goal is to get students talking to each other about their code
+ have documentation at end of slides

+ Visualizing a dataset
--

+ What else?

+ So much more...

---

# Final Thoughts
--

+ Python is a powerful tool for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
--

+ Integrating it into your workflow takes practice and a commitment to not giving up (Google is your friend)
--

+ Distributions like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) make it easy to get started (and you should be able to install it on your work computer)
--

+ It's best if you just start off with Python 3 (what we've been using)
--
