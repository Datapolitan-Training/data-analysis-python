---

# Challenges We Face
--

+ Data is hard to get (web scraping)
--

+ Data is too messy
--

+ Data is too large
--

+ Operation is too complex
--

+ Need to repeat (or automate) tasks
--

+ Need to document analytical steps

???
+ Establish key reasons for using a programming language

---

![img-right-40](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png)
# What is Python?
--

+ [Open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) programming langage
--

+ Works in standalone scripts or as part of fully-featured applications
--

+ Strong support for data analysis and visualization, as well as other programming tasks

???
+ Provide basic facts on Python for context

---

# Python vs. Excel
--

+ Python is a _programming language_ while Excel is an _application_ 
--

+ Python can work with much larger datasets than Excel
--

+ Python can perform more complex operations than Excel
--

+ Python commands can be easily saved, re-run, and automated
--

+ Python doesn't have the icons, animations, and wizards of Excel


<!-- + Python doesn't have many of the icons, animations, and wizards that are part of applications like Excel 
+ Python can work with larger datasets and perform more complex operations, but requires explicit instructions
+ Python has more potential to build custom operations and record their operation for future use -->

???
+ Compare Python directly to Excel for context

# Important Things to Keep in Mind
--

+ Integrating Python into your workflow takes practice and a commitment to not giving up (Google is your friend)
--

+ Distributions like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) make it easy to get started (and you should be able to install it on your work computer)
--

+ It's best if you just start off with Python 3 (what we've been using)
--

+ For more on the difference, [check this out](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-2-vs-python-3-practical-considerations-2)

???
+ Key ideas are introduced for how to use Python

exclude:true
# Python Facts

+ Comes from Monty Python and Flying Circus
+ Very flexible and highly readable
+ Can work on the commandline and in scripts

---

# Getting Started

+ We're going to use a [Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
--

+ Web application that runs code, as well as visualizations and explanatory text
--

+ Can save notebooks and share them with others
--

+ Look in your packet for the weblink to start your own Notebook
--
![img-right-30](images/notebook_start.png)
+ Start a new Python 3 Notebook

---

# Using Jupyter Notebook
--

![img-right-45](images/notebook_run.png)
+ Type code into a block and run the block
--

+ You can also press `Shift` + `Enter` to run a block
--
![img-right-40](images/notebook_output.png)
+ The output (if any) will print below
--

+ You can type as much or as little code as you'd like
--

+ You can re-run the block as many times as you'd like
--

+ Each webpage is a self-contained program (you can't share variables between webpages)
--

+ Great for experimenting, prototyping, or simple scripts

---

# What is Syntax?
--

![img-center-80](images/syntax.png)
.caption[Image Credit: AnonMoos, Public Domain via [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ABasic_constituent_structure_analysis_English_sentence.svg)]

---

# Python Syntax
--

+ [Variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm) hold some value
--

+ You can think of them like the subject of a sentence
--

+ We create variables and assign a value using the `=` sign
```python
a = 1 # assign the value 1 to the variable a ("a is 1")
b = 2 # assign the value 2 to the variable c ("b is 2")
```
--
+ We can perform operations with mathematical operators
```python
c = a + b # add the value of a and b, and assign to variable c 
# ("c is a and b")
```

---

# Your turn
+ Calculate the sum of `5` and `7`, assign the result to a variable and print the result

---

Source: http://xkcd.com/353/

---

# Functions
--

+ We can use built-in functions for operations
```python
print(c) # print the value of variable c
```
--
+ This is a pre-defined operation (like `=SUM` in Excel)
--

+ Functions are like verbs describing an action

---

exclude:true
# Benefits of Functions
+ Make your code more modular
+ Can write your own functions
+ For now, we'll use functions created by others
+ These are usually made avaiable through packages

---

# Packages
--

+ Provide a set of pre-constructed functions
--

+ Usually for some specific task<br>
--
(accessing databases, creating charts, scraping the web)
--

+ If you need to do something, there's probably a package for it
--

+ This helps expand the core functionality of Python
--

+ Even some basic things require packages<br>
--
(like [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) and [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html))
--

+ Import packages using the keyword [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)

---

# Important Packages for Exercises
+ [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/) provides data analytics functionality similar to a spreadsheet 
--

+ [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/) provides data visualization functionality
--

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

--

+ We alias them to make it easier to distinguish functions

# Old Faithful Exercise - Data Download
#### `http://training.datapolitan.com/data-analysis-python/data/faithful.csv`

![img-center-70](images/old_faithful.jpeg)

---

# Analyzing the Data
+ Import the data
```python
df = pd.read_csv('http://training.datapolitan.com/data-analysis-python/data/faithful.csv',index_col=0)
```
--
+ Inspect the data
```python
df.head() # Show the first 5 rows of data
df.tail() # Show the last 5 rows of data
```
--
+ Count the number of rows
```python
df.count() # Count the number of non-null values in each column
```
---

# Analyzing the Data
+ Find the range of values
```python
df.max() # Find the maximum value
df.min() # Find the minimum value
```
--
+ Find the mean (average)
```python
df.mean() # Find the mean value of all non-null columns
```
--
+ Find the median (middle)
```python
df.median() # Find the median value
```
--
+ Or do it all together
```python
df.describe() # Provide summary statistics for all columns
```
---

# Referencing Columns
--

+ To reference a particular column, you use the following syntax:
--

```python
df['Column Name'] # Example of the syntax for referencing a single column
```
--
+ We can then call functions on just that column
--

+ For example, to just get the mean for `eruptions`
```python
df['eruptions'].mean() # Calculate the mean of the eruptions column
```

---

# Visualizing the Data
--

+ To visualize the data, we need to first import the `matplotlib` package
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Imports the visualization package
%matplotlib inline 
# This tells Jupyter to use the package in the webpage
```
--
![img-right-40](images/faithful_chart.png)
+ Then we can create a simple histogram using the `hist()` function
```python
df.hist() # Create a histogram
```
---

# Visualizing the Data
+ We can create a simple scatter plot that shows the values plotted against each other
```python
df.plot(kind='scatter',x='waiting',y='eruptions') # Create a scatter plot 
```
![img-center-60](images/faithful_scatter.png)
---

exclude:true
# Function Chaining
--

+ We can string operations together using the [dot method](http://reeborg.ca/docs/oop_py_en/oop.html)
--

+ This means we can chain operations using a simple dot between operations
--

+ Python executes these from left to right (like we read)
--

+ Example:
```python
car.door.open() # Object car has attribute door with function open
```

<!-- + This is a paradigm called [object-oriented programming](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/)
+ You don't need to fully understand this to program in Python&nbsp;but it helps -->

---

# Breaking Down the Code

```python
df.plot(kind='scatter',x='waiting',y='eruptions') # Create a scatter plot
```
--

+ `df` is our dataframe object (the noun)
--

+ We call the `plot` function (the verb)
--

+ We give Python three parameters telling it how to plot (adverbs that modify the verb)
--

+ "_Create a `scatter` plot with the parameters `x='waiting',y='eruptions'`_"
--

+ We'll expermient more with this later

# 311 Data Exercise
+ Load the data from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/datapolitan-training-files/311_Requests_Oct15_Nov20.csv`
+ Don't add the `index_col=0` that we had before
+ Ignore the warning you get ([more on that warning](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27232309/1808021))
![img-center-90](images/error.png)
+ Inspect the data based on the techniques we just used

---

# Summary Statistics on 311 Data
+ How many columns are in the data?
+ How many rows are in the data?
+ What is the time range of the data?
+ What is the result of running `describe()`?
+ Try creating a histogram
+ Work together and help each other out

---

# Data Types
+ Run `df.dtypes`
+ What are the results?
+ What do you think they mean?

???
+ Introduce the concept of data types

---

# Data Types
+ Python has various containers that define the type of data
+ Excel has the same (think dates, numbers, text, percentages, etc)
+ In our example there are `int64` and `float64`
+ What do you think these are?

???

---

# Integers and Floats
+ Both are [numeric types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)
+ Integers are whole numbers (decimals get dropped)
+ Floats include the decimal points

???
+ Introduce data types and the different operations
+ Key reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex

# Other Types of Interest
+ Boolean (`True` and `False`) 
+ Strings

# Let's Get Back to the Data

---

# Going Deeper into the Data
+ Which borough has the most complaints?
+ Which Complaint Type has the most service requests?<br>
And why might that be a little misleading?


???
+ Students will conduct the same commands from Faithful with 311 exercise
+ Students will hit the roadblocks
+ Can't run summary statistics
+ Exercise will be run through script showing comments (not on slide)
+ Script will mirror the Faithful with intention of not working

# Selecting Columns
```python
df_subset_1col = df['col1']
df_subset = df[[col1,col2,col3]]
```
???
+ Discuss how to subset the columns
+ Prepare to introduce data structures in Python

---

# Selecting Rows

# Remember
--

+ Python is a powerful tool for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
--

+ Integrating it into your workflow takes practice and a commitment to not giving up (Google is your friend)
--

+ Distributions like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) make it easy to get started (and you should be able to install it on your work computer)
--

+ It's best if you just start off with Python 3 (what we've been using)
--

+ For more on the difference, [check this out](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-2-vs-python-3-practical-considerations-2)
--

+ Jupyter Notebooks work in [multiple programming languages](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages) (with proper configuration)

---

# Resources
--

+ [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - One of the best Q&A sites for technical questions of all kinds
