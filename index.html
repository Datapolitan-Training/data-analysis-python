# Welcome

---

# Introduce Yourself to Your Neighbor
+ Who you are
+ Where you work
+ What you've done with code (any code)

---

# What to Expect Today
???
+ Facilitator sets key expectations for the class
--

+ Introduction to Python
--

+ Why use Python?
--

+ Using Python in Data Analysis
--

+ Getting Familiar: Python Syntax + Jupyter Notebook
--

+ 311 Data Analysis
--

+ Presentations!

---

# What Not To Expect Today
--

+ Becoming a Python expert<br>
--
(That takes much longer than we have)
--

+ Becoming a data analytics pro<br>
--
(Also not possible in the time we have)
--

+ Becoming a visualization wizard<br>
--
(Yep, you guessed it)

---

# Also...
--

+ We don't have all the answers
--

+ You won't either when you do this yourself
--

+ Feel free to share if you know something
--

+ But pay attention to how we find the answers we're looking for
--

+ That's really how you'll learn

---

# Housekeeping
--

+ We’ll have one 15 minute break in the morning and a 15 minute break in the afternoon
--

+ We'll have 1 hour for lunch
--

+ Class will start promptly after break
--

+ Feel free to use the bathroom if you need during class
--

+ Please take any phone conversations into the hall to not disrupt the class

???
+ Expectations and norms are established with the class

---

# What is Analysis?

???
+ Facilitator frames the class discussion with basic definition of analysis leading into the need for tools
+ Emphasize the importance of why over the tools (ie don't have a solution in search of a problem)
--

>“Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison”

???
+ Facilitator emphasizes data isn't always easy to work with

---

# Challenges We Face

???
+ Facilitator ideally prompts participants to describe their challenges with data
+ Students identify key challenges and (if possible) how they see Python helping with those challenges
--

+ Data is hard to get (web scraping)
--

+ Data is too messy
--

+ Data is too large
--

+ Operation is too complex
--

+ Need to repeat (or automate) tasks
--

+ Need to document analytical steps

???
+ Establish key reasons for using a programming language

---

![img-right-40](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png)
# What is Python?
???
+ Facilitator solicts basic description of Python from class
+ Allows facilitator to gauge level of understanding/awareness in the room
+ All else fails, remind them they convinced someone to let them take the class. What did they tell them?

--

+ [Open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) programming langage
--

+ Can run in standalone scripts or [full applications](http://www.hartmannsoftware.com/Blog/Articles_from_Software_Fans/Most-Famous-Software-Programs-Written-in-Python)
--

+ Can easily do data analysis and visualization
--

+ Can also do other programming tasks

---

# Python vs. Excel
???
+ Facilitator compares Python directly to Excel for context (assuming most participants are well-acquainted with Excel)

--

+ Python is a _programming language_ while Excel is an _application_ 
--

+ Python can work with much larger datasets than Excel
--

+ Python can perform more complex operations than Excel
--

+ Python commands can be easily saved, re-run, and automated
--

+ Python doesn't have the icons, animations, and wizards of Excel


<!-- + Python doesn't have many of the icons, animations, and wizards that are part of applications like Excel 
+ Python can work with larger datasets and perform more complex operations, but requires explicit instructions
+ Python has more potential to build custom operations and record their operation for future use -->

.caption[Image Credit: Michael Barnett [CC BY-SA 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5), via Wikimedia Commons]

???
+ New Orleans was able to dramatically improve the distribution of smoke alarms with data from the US Census Bureau and better using their own administrative data, brought together, cleaned, and analyzed in code (actually R)
+ [The code is made available online](https://github.com/enigma-io/smoke-signals-model)
+ For more information, see [this presentation](https://nola.gov/performance-and-accountability/reports/nolalytics-reports/full-report-on-analytics-informed-smoke-alarm-outr/)

exclude:true
# Python Facts

+ Comes from Monty Python and Flying Circus
+ Very flexible and highly readable
+ Can work on the commandline and in scripts

---

# Getting Started

+ We're going to use a [Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
--

+ Web application that runs code, as well as visualizations and explanatory text
--

+ Can save notebooks and share them with others
--

+ Look in your packet for the weblink to start your own Notebook
--
![img-right-30](images/notebook_start.png)
+ Start a new Python 3 Notebook

---

# Using Jupyter Notebook
--

![img-right-45](images/notebook_run.png)
+ Type code into a block and run the block
--

+ You can also press `Shift` + `Enter` to run a block
--
![img-right-40](images/notebook_output.png)
+ The output (if any) will print below
--

+ You can type as much or as little code as you'd like
--

+ You can re-run the block as many times as you'd like
--

+ Each webpage is a self-contained program (you can't share variables between webpages)
--

+ Great for experimenting, prototyping, or simple scripts

---

# Your Turn
+ Change the code to print your name
+ Re-run to make sure it prints properly
+ Have fun -> you won't break anything

???
+ Facilitator provides a confidence building exercise for students to become comfortable with the environment
---

# What is Syntax?
???
+ Facilitator prompts students to think about the role of grammar in spoken language as a bridge to understanding the importance of correct syntax in programming
--

![img-center-80](images/syntax.png)
.caption[Image Credit: AnonMoos, Public Domain via [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ABasic_constituent_structure_analysis_English_sentence.svg)]

---

# Python Syntax
???
+ Facilitator connects the grammar metaphor to the basic elements of Python syntax
--

+ [Variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm) hold some value
--

+ You can think of them like the subject of a sentence
--

+ We create variables and assign a value using the `=` sign
```python
a = 1 # assign the value 1 to the variable a ("a is 1")
b = 2 # assign the value 2 to the variable c ("b is 2")
```
--
+ We can perform operations with mathematical operators
```python
c = a + b # add the value of a and b, and assign to variable c 
# ("c is a and b")
```

---

# Your turn
+ Calculate the sum of `5` and `7`, assign the result to a variable and print the result
+ If you want to see an interactive example of what's going on, try [the Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/live.html#mode=edit)

---

# Functions
???
+ Facilitator introduces pre-defined functions in Python
+ With classes experienced in Excel, references to Excel functions can be helpful
--

+ We can use built-in functions for operations
```python
print(c) # print the value of variable c
```
--
+ This is a pre-defined operation (like `=SUM` in Excel)
--

+ Functions are like verbs describing an action
--

+ Unfortunately, there aren't many [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) to basic Python

---

exclude:true
# Benefits of Functions
+ Make your code more modular
+ Can write your own functions
+ For now, we'll use functions created by others
+ These are usually made available through packages

---

# Packages
--

+ Provide a set of pre-constructed functions
--

+ Usually for some specific task<br>
--
(accessing databases, creating charts, scraping the web)
--

+ If you need to do something, there's probably a package for it
--

+ This helps expand the core functionality of Python
--

+ Even some basic things require packages<br>
--
(like [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) and [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html))
--

+ Import packages using the keyword [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)

---

# Important Packages for Exercises
+ [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/) provides data analytics functionality similar to a spreadsheet 
--

+ [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/) provides data visualization functionality
--

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

--

+ We alias them to make it easier to distinguish functions

---

# Analyzing the Data
+ Import the data
```python
df = pd.read_csv('http://training.datapolitan.com/data-analysis-python/data/faithful.csv',index_col=0)
```
--
+ Inspect the data
```python
df.head() # Show the first 5 rows of data
df.tail() # Show the last 5 rows of data
```
--
+ Count the number of rows
```python
df.count() # Count the number of non-null values in each column
```
---

# Analyzing the Data
+ Find the range of values
```python
df.max() # Find the maximum value
df.min() # Find the minimum value
```
--
+ Find the mean (average)
```python
df.mean() # Find the mean value of all non-null columns
```
--
+ Find the median (middle)
```python
df.median() # Find the median value
```
--
+ Or do it all together
```python
df.describe() # Provide summary statistics for all columns
```
---

# Referencing Columns
--

+ To reference a particular column, you use the following syntax:
--

```python
df['Column Name'] # Example of the syntax for referencing a single column
```
--
+ We can then call functions on just that column
--

+ For example, to just get the mean for `eruptions`
```python
df['eruptions'].mean() # Calculate the mean of the eruptions column
```

---

# Visualizing the Data
--

+ To visualize the data, we need to first import the `matplotlib` package
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Imports the visualization package
%matplotlib inline 
# This tells Jupyter to use the package in the webpage
```
--
![img-right-40](images/faithful_chart.png)
+ Then we can create a simple histogram using the `hist()` function
```python
df.hist() # Create a histogram
```
---

# Visualizing the Data
+ We can create a simple scatter plot that shows the values plotted against each other
```python
df.plot(kind='scatter',x='waiting',y='eruptions') # Create a scatter plot 
```
![img-center-60](images/faithful_scatter.png)

---

# Breaking Down the Code

```python
df.plot(kind='scatter',x='waiting',y='eruptions') # Create a scatter plot
```
--

+ `df` is our dataframe object (the noun)
--

+ We call the `plot` function (the verb)
--

+ We give Python three parameters telling it how to plot (adverbs that modify the verb)
--

+ "_Create a `scatter` plot with the parameters `x='waiting',y='eruptions'`_"
--

+ We'll experiment more with this later

---

# Your Turn
???
+ Release exercise for participants to practice skills, with an emphasis on changing the given code and learning the content
+ Facilitator reviews what they changed and anything they learned before putting them on break
--

+ Using the code we just used, start experimenting with altering the code to get a different result
--

+ Look at the documentation for [`plot()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.19/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) and [visualizing in pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.19.2/visualization.html#visualization-scatter) for ideas
--

+ Find at least one attribute to change

# Just Some Quick Points

---

# Data Structures
--

+ Remember the `df` object?
--

+ It's called a [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe) 
--

+ It's a basic data structure that stores our data
--

+ Data structures are a way of organizing data in a computer program
--

+ The method of organizing data differs across types, allowing for different applications
--

+ Python has [lots of different data structures](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) that we aren't going to talk about

???
+ Briefly introduce the concept of data structures
+ Demystify the idea for further study

# Data Types
--

+ Python has various containers that define the type of data

--

+ In our example there are `int64` and `float64`
--

+ What do you think these are?

+ Start introduction with numeric types

---

# Integers and Floats
--

+ Both are [numeric types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)
--

+ Integers are whole numbers (decimals get dropped)
--

+ Floats include the decimal points

???
+ Introduce data types and the different operations
+ Key reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex

---

# Other Types of Interest

# Let's Get Back to the Data

---

# Summary Statistics on 311 Data
+ How many columns are in the data?
+ How many rows are in the data?
+ What is the time range of the data?
+ What is the result of running `describe()`?
+ Try creating a histogram
+ Work together and help each other out

+ Students will conduct the same commands from Faithful with 311 exercise
+ Students will hit the roadblocks
+ Can't run summary statistics
+ Exercise will be run through script showing comments (not on slide)
+ Script will mirror the Faithful with intention of not working

---

# Aggregating Data
--

+ What is a PivotTable in Excel and when do you use it?
--

+ `GroupBy` is the same for making summaries
--

```python
df.groupby('Column you want to group')['Column you want to count'].count()
```
--
+ In this case
```python
df.groupby('Borough')['Unique Key'].count()
```
--
![img-center-50](images/borough_count_table.png)

---

# Aggregating Data
+ To sort the list
```python
df.groupby('Borough')['Unique Key'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
--

![img-center-50](images/borough_count_table_sorted.png)
--

+ This is called **function chaining**

---

# Function Chaining
--

+ We can string operations together using the [dot method](http://reeborg.ca/docs/oop_py_en/oop.html)
--

+ This means we can chain operations using a simple dot between operations
--

+ Python executes these from left to right (like we read)
--

+ Example:
```python
df.groupby('Borough')['Unique Key'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

---

# Function Chaining
```python
df.groupby('Borough')['Unique Key'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
--

+ We first run the `groupby()` function to aggregate the values
--

+ Then the results using the `count()` function
--

+ Then sort the result by values using the `sort_values()` function
--

+ What if we want to plot the result?
--

+ We just add a `.plot()` (with some parameters)
--

+ Try it yourself

<!-- + This is a paradigm called [object-oriented programming](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/)
+ You don't need to fully understand this to program in Python&nbsp;but it helps -->

---

# Plotting Service Requests by Borough

	title='Count of NYC 311 Service Requests by Borough')
```

# Filtering and Sorting

---

# Selecting Columns
+ Remember to select a column of data, we do this:
```python
df['column1']
```
--
+ To select multiple columns, we do this:
```python
df[['column1','column2','column3']]
```
--
+ We can assign this subset to another dataframe
```python
df2 = df[['column1','column2','column3']]
```
--
+ Identify key columns and assign them to a new dataframe
--

+ Hint: Use `df.columns` to get exact column names

???
+ Discuss how to subset the columns
+ Prepare to introduce data structures in Python

---

# Selecting Rows
```python
df[df['Column Name'] == 'Value']
```
--
+ `df['Column Name'] == 'Value'` is the test we use to filter on
--

+ `==` means "equivalent to" 
--

+ `=` is for assigning value
--

+ We can also assign this subset to another dataframe
```python
df3 = df[df['Column Name'] == 'Value']
```

---

# Your Turn
+ Find all the complaints in Brooklyn
+ After that, find complaints in your ZIP code

---

# Selecting Rows
+ For example 
```python
df[df['Complaint Type']=='Noise']
```
--
+ This will filter for Complaint Type "Noise"
--

+ We can count these
```python
df[df['Complaint Type']=='Noise']['Unique Key'].count() # 6523
```
--
![img-right-40](images/noise_count_table_box.png)
+ But
--

+ How do we match these?

---

# Selecting Rows - Fuzzy Matching
+ To do a fuzzy matching, we need to chain another function
```python
df[df['Complaint Type'].str.contains('Noise')]
```
--
+ `str` is the string [object in Python](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/)
--

+ It has a function called `contains()` that will do a fuzzy match
--

+ We pass it the parameter we're looking for 'Noise'
--

+ We could also use the function [`startswith()`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_startswith.htm)
---

# Try It Out

# Final Exercise
???
+ Facilitator prompts students to think of an interesting/engaging question
+ Students share them with the class and students are given the opportunity to pair up
+ Students can move around the classroom to work together in pairs or small groups
+ Facilitators and TA work with students to answer their questions with additional resources or skills as necessary, but learning should be student driven ("We've given you enough to be dangerous...")
--

+ Take a moment and think about what you've looked at
--

+ What questions are you interested in exploring?
--

+ Take a moment to write them down in your workbook

---

# Your Turn
--

![img-right-40](images/new_notebook.png)
+ Open a new Jupyter Notebook
--

+ Load the data and begin exploring your question
--

+ Try to find a story in the data (if you can)
--

+ But mostly just have fun
--

+ We're here to help
--

+ Here's [a list of functions](#pandas-reference)

---

exclude:true
# old exercise
+ filter for a different complaint type
+ Find the borough, ZIP code, or community board with the most complaints
+ Try grouping by another column (Location Type or Agency)

---

# Debugging
--

+ Everyone makes mistakes
--

+ It's just a matter of how serious they are<br>
--
_And fixing them_
--

+ **Syntax errors** -> using the wrong instructions
--

+ **Semantic errors** -> doing the wrong things
--

+ When in doubt, review the documentation

???
+ Students will be introduced to key concepts in identifying and resolving errors
+ This will be done with a lecture/discussion leading into an exercise
+ Class exercise finding errors in code -> slide with code snippets in Markdown with errors
+ deal with issue of correctness

---

# Exercise

+ Debug your neighbor's Python code and verify results

???
+ Students will examine another student's code, run the code, and fix any errors
+ Students will have a better understanding of how to think in code
+ Goal is to get students talking to each other about their code
+ have documentation at end of slides

# What We've Covered
--

+ Basic Python syntax
--

+ Working in Jupyter
--

+ Opening a dataset
--

+ Exploring a dataset
--

+ Visualizing a dataset
--

+ What else?

---

# What We Haven't Covered
--

+ All the data structures in Python
--

+ Deep dive into algorithms
--

+ More Packages&nbsp;
--
and there are [a lot of packages](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/?)&nbsp;

# Remember
--

+ Python is a powerful tool for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
--

+ Integrating it into your workflow takes practice and a commitment to not giving up (Google is your friend)
--

+ Distributions like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) make it easy to get started (and you should be able to install it on your work computer)
--

+ It's best if you just start off with Python 3 (what we've been using)
--

# Lists
+ The most versatile data structure in Python
+ Can contain multiple data types
+ Can be sliced or added to
+ Are mutable (can be changed)
+ Access individual items by index


![img-center-40](images/list1.png)

exclude:true
# List functions
+ append(_object_) - add object to list
+ extend(_list_) - extend original list with elements of specified in list
+ insert(_index, object_) - insert object at specified index
+ pop(_[index]_) - pop element from list at index and return (default to last value in list)
+ remove(_value_) - delete first occurrence of value from list (no return)

---

exclude:true
# List functions
+ reverse - reverse the order of the list in place
+ sort() - sort the list
+ count(_value_) - count number of occurrences of value
+ index(_value_) - find index of first value and return

# Sets
+ An unordered collection with no duplicate values

![img-center-55](images/set1.png)

---

exclude:true
# When to use sets

exclude:true
# When to use tuples
+ When your data doesn’t change
+ When performance is important (tuples provide better performance because of their immutability)

exclude:true
# Dictionaries
+ Stores data in key-value pairs
+ Provides lookup based on custom keys (instead of numerical indexes)
+ Keys must be unique

![img-center-100](images/dict1.png)

exclude:true
# When to use a dictionary
+ When you need to lookup values by a custom key
+ When you need a fast way to lookup values

---

exclude:true
# Things to remember with a dictionary
+ Key-value pairs aren’t stored in order (use `collections.OrderedDict` if you need to key order is important)
+ `collections.defaultdict` is a more flexible implementation for creating a dictionary and adding values
